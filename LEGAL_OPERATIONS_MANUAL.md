## UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW (UPL) - RED LINES

### What You CAN Do:

**Notarization Services:**
✅ Witness signatures on documents
✅ Administer oaths and affirmations  
✅ Verify identity using acceptable ID
✅ Execute notarial certificates
✅ Certify copies of documents (non-vital records)
✅ Take acknowledgments and jurats

**Administrative Services:**
✅ Fill out government forms with client-provided information
✅ File documents with government agencies as courier
✅ Provide general information about processes (not advice)
✅ Refer clients to government websites for requirements

### What You CANNOT Do:

**Legal Advice (UPL Violations):**
❌ Recommend which document type a client needs
❌ Explain the legal effect of signing a document
❌ Interpret document language or terms
❌ Advise whether a document will accomplish client's goals
❌ Recommend one legal option over another
❌ Draft custom legal documents
❌ Fill in substantive terms in legal documents
❌ Advise on legal rights or obligations

**Examples of UPL to AVOID:**

**CLIENT:** "Should I use a Power of Attorney or a Living Will?"
- ❌ WRONG: "For your situation, you need a durable power of attorney."
- ✅ CORRECT: "I cannot advise which document is best for you—that's a legal decision. I can notarize either document once you've decided, or I can refer you to an attorney."

**CLIENT:** "What does this clause mean in my mortgage?"
- ❌ WRONG: "That's a prepayment penalty clause. It means..."
- ✅ CORRECT: "I cannot interpret legal documents. My role is to witness your signature. If you have questions about the terms, please contact your lender or attorney before signing."

**CLIENT:** "Should I form an LLC or a corporation?"
- ❌ WRONG: "An LLC is better for small businesses because..."
- ✅ CORRECT: "I can't advise on business structure—that's a legal and tax decision. I recommend consulting an attorney or CPA. Once you've decided, I can help file the paperwork."

**CLIENT:** "Do I need an apostille for this document?"
- ❌ WRONG: "Yes, for your situation you definitely need an apostille."
- ✅ CORRECT: "I can't advise on which authentication your specific situation requires. The receiving party abroad or their embassy can tell you what they need. Once you know, I can help with the apostille application."

## LOAN SIGNING AGENT - UPL BOUNDARIES

### Your Role:

You are a **neutral third-party notary** who ensures:
- Documents are signed correctly
- Signers are properly identified  
- Notarizations are executed properly
- Documents are returned to title company

### What You CAN Say During Signings:

✅ "This is the Closing Disclosure. It shows your loan amount, interest rate, and fees. Please review it carefully."

✅ "You'll be signing here, here, and here. Each signature should match the name on your ID."

✅ "This is the promissory note—it states you're borrowing $[amount] at [rate]% interest."

✅ "The initial here indicates you've received this disclosure. The signature at the bottom executes the agreement."

✅ "If you have questions about any terms, rates, or conditions, please contact your loan officer or attorney before signing."

### What You CANNOT Say:

❌ "This is a great rate—you should definitely take this loan."

❌ "I wouldn't worry about that prepayment penalty clause."

❌ "You don't need to read all that—it's standard language."

❌ "If you don't like this term, you can probably negotiate it."

❌ "Yes, you should sign this" (when they ask if they should)

### The Safe Script When Asked Questions:

**CLIENT:** "Do you think this is a good deal?"
- ✅ "I can't advise on loan terms. I'm here only to notarize. For advice, please speak with your loan officer, real estate agent, or attorney."

**CLIENT:** "What happens if I can't make a payment?"
- ✅ "I can't answer legal or financial questions. Your loan documents have default provisions, but I can't interpret them. Please contact your lender or an attorney."

**CLIENT:** "Should I get the title insurance?"
- ✅ "That's a decision you need to make with your real estate professional or attorney. I can't advise on insurance."

## I-9 VERIFICATION - SCOPE LIMITS

### Your Authority:

You are an **Authorized Representative** of the employer under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a to complete Section 2 of Form I-9.

### What You CAN Do:

✅ Examine original documents from Lists A, B, or C
✅ Verify documents appear genuine and relate to the employee
✅ Fill out Section 2 of Form I-9 completely
✅ Sign as "Authorized Representative"
✅ Explain the I-9 process itself (what will happen)

### What You CANNOT Do:

❌ Notarize the I-9 form or any part of it

❌ Provide immigration legal advice
❌ Tell employee which documents to use
❌ Reject specific document types (unless truly unacceptable per rules)
❌ Prepare any immigration forms other than I-9
❌ Advise on work authorization status
❌ Advise on visa types or immigration options

### Safe Responses:

**EMPLOYEE:** "Which ID should I use?"
- ✅ "You can use any documents from Lists A, B, or C as shown on the form. I can't recommend which specific documents—that's your choice."

**EMPLOYEE:** "Will this affect my visa status?"
- ✅ "I can't advise on immigration status. I'm only authorized to complete this employment form. For immigration questions, consult an immigration attorney."

**EMPLOYEE:** "Can I use this document?" (shows something unclear)
- ✅ "Let me check the USCIS acceptable documents list. [If not on list:] This document is not on the USCIS acceptable documents list for I-9. You'll need to provide a document from List A, B, or C."

### Critical DHS Rules:

- NEVER refuse to accept a valid document because of national origin
- NEVER specify which documents an employee must present
- NEVER provide more scrutiny to some employees than others (discrimination)

❌ Guarantee PA DOS will issue the apostille
❌ Translate documents or certify translations (unless qualified translator)
❌ Provide legal advice about foreign country requirements
❌ Advise on visa applications or immigration matters

### Safe Responses:

**CLIENT:** "Do I need an apostille or authentication?"
- ✅ "Apostilles are for Hague Convention member countries. Authentication is for non-member countries. You should check with the receiving party abroad about their specific requirements. I can help you obtain whichever one you need."

**CLIENT:** "Will this apostille be accepted in [country]?"
- ✅ "Apostilles are generally accepted in all Hague Convention countries, which includes [check list]. However, I recommend confirming with the specific organization or government office where you'll use it. I can't advise on foreign country requirements."

**CLIENT:** "What documents do I need apostilled for my visa application?"
- ✅ "I can't advise on visa requirements—that's outside my scope. The embassy or consulate of the destination country can tell you exactly which documents they need. Once you know, I can help obtain the apostilles."

- ✅ "That's a legal and tax decision I can't make for you. I recommend consulting an attorney or CPA who can advise based on your specific situation. Once you've decided, I can help with the paperwork."

**CLIENT:** "How many shares should my corporation have?"
- ✅ "I can't advise on your corporation's structure. That's a legal decision for you or your attorney. I can file whatever structure you decide on."

**CLIENT:** "Can you write my operating agreement?"
- ✅ "I can provide a basic template form, but I can't customize legal provisions for your situation—that's legal work requiring an attorney. The template is for informational purposes only."

**CLIENT:** "Do I need to file annual reports?"
- ✅ "Pennsylvania requires annual reports for certain entities. You should verify your specific requirements with the PA Department of State or your attorney. I can send you reminders and help file if needed."

## REMOTE ONLINE NOTARIZATION (RON) - SPECIFIC RULES

### Identity Verification Methods (PA Law):

Must use ONE of these methods:
1. **Personal knowledge** (you know the signer personally)
2. **Credible witness** (someone vouches for signer)
3. **Remote identity proofing** (RON standard):
   - Credential analysis (platform scans ID)
   - Knowledge-based authentication (KBA questions based on public records)

### RON Session Requirements:

✅ You must be physically located in Pennsylvania
✅ Signer can be located anywhere (including outside U.S.)
✅ Clear real-time audio-video communication required
✅ Record entire session audio and video
✅ Keep recording for 10 years
✅ Electronic notarial certificate must state "by means of communication technology"
✅ Journal entry must note: "Remote via [platform]; ID: credential analysis + KBA"

### What Can Go Wrong (Refusal Reasons):

You MUST refuse to perform RON if:
- Signer fails KBA (identity not verified)
- ID document fails credential analysis
- Poor audio/video quality prevents clear communication
- Signer appears coerced or lacks capacity
- Document is incomplete or illegible
- You suspect fraud or forgery

### Safe Responses:

**SIGNER:** "Can you notarize this will remotely?"
- ✅ "Pennsylvania law requires wills to have two witnesses physically present. I can notarize your will via mobile service with witnesses, but not remotely. Alternatively, I can notarize a power of attorney or living will remotely if that meets your needs."

**SIGNER:** "I failed the KBA questions. Can we skip that?"
- ✅ "I'm sorry, but Pennsylvania law requires passing the KBA for remote identity verification. Without that, I cannot proceed. You could try again in 24 hours, or we could schedule an in-person mobile notary appointment instead."

## PRICING TRANSPARENCY & PA FEE LIMITS

### Pennsylvania Notary Fee Limits (4 Pa. Code § 161.1):

| Notarial Act | Maximum Fee by PA Law |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| Acknowledgment | $5 per signature |
| Oath or affirmation | $5 |
| Signature witnessing | $5 per signature |
| Copy certification | $5 per document |
| Jurat | $5 |

**For RON:** Some sources indicate $15 may be allowed for electronic/remote acts. **VERIFY with PA DOS before launch.**

- PLUS separate fees for:
  - Technology platform fee

  - Administrative fee

**Example (Mobile):**
✅ CORRECT: "$125 total: $5-15 notary fee + $100 travel fee + $10 admin fee"
❌ WRONG: "$125 notary fee"

**Example (Loan Signing):**
✅ CORRECT: "$150 total: $15 notary fees + $135 signing agent service fee (includes printing, travel, scanning, shipping)"
❌ WRONG: "$150 per notarization"

### Client Communication:

Always provide itemized breakdown:
- "The notary fee is $15 per signature as allowed by Pennsylvania law."

## CLIENT INTAKE & SCREENING

### Questions to Ask (Notarization):

1. "What type of document needs to be notarized?"
2. "Will all signers be present?"
3. "Do all signers have valid government-issued photo ID?"

5. "Is this for use in the United States or abroad?" (apostille consideration)

### Red Flags - REFUSE SERVICE if:

- Signer appears coerced or confused

- Document has blank spaces in critical sections
- You suspect fraud, forgery, or duress
- Signer cannot communicate clearly
- Signer asks you to backdate or certify false statements
- Someone asks you to notarize your own signature
- Someone offers you extra money to "overlook" something

### When to Refuse:

You have the right and duty to refuse if:
- You're not comfortable with the situation
- Legal requirements are not met
- You suspect fraud
- You would be violating UPL rules
- Signer fails identity verification

**Safe refusal language:**
"I'm unable to perform this notarization because [identity not verified / concerns about the circumstances / outside my authorized scope]. I recommend [consulting an attorney / trying again with proper ID / etc.]."
