      question: "How fast can you get to my location for mobile service?",
      answer: "For Erie County, we offer same-day service with typical arrival within 2-4 hours of booking. Emergency/urgent requests can often be accommodated within 1-2 hours for an additional rush fee. We also offer scheduled appointments for your convenience."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I need for an online notarization?",
      answer: "You'll need: (1) A valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license or passport), (2) A device with camera and microphone (computer or smartphone), (3) Stable internet connection, (4) Your unsigned document in PDF format. The entire process takes about 10-15 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you notarize wills and estate documents?",
      answer: "Yes, we notarize powers of attorney, living wills, and many estate documents. However, Pennsylvania law requires certain documents (like last wills and testaments) to have witnesses present. For these, we recommend our mobile service where we can bring witnesses if needed. Contact us to discuss your specific document."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your notaries background-checked?",
      answer: "Absolutely. All Notroom notaries are Pennsylvania-commissioned, bonded, and have undergone comprehensive background checks. Our loan signing agents carry professional liability insurance. Your security and privacy are our top priorities."
