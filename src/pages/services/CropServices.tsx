                  Is this compliant with PA Department of State rules?

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  Yes. We provide CROP-ready services that align with Pennsylvania's Commercial Registered Office Provider requirements under 15 Pa.C.S. § 109 and § 415. We maintain a physical Pennsylvania address and handle service of process acceptance and official mail forwarding per written service agreement. Before listing us on any state filing, we will execute the required CROP service contract with you to ensure full legal compliance.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  Yes. If you currently have a different registered office address on file with the PA Department of State, you can file a Statement of Change to update it to our address. We'll provide the necessary forms and instructions. The state filing fee for a Statement of Change is approximately $70 (paid directly to PA DOS). Once approved and executed, we can serve as your new registered office. This process typically takes 1-2 weeks for state processing.

                  How do renewals work for the registered office service?

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  Your registered office service renews annually. We'll send you a renewal notice 60 days before your anniversary date via email and through your client portal. You can renew online with a credit card or ACH payment. If you choose not to renew, we require 30 days' written notice so you have time to designate a new registered office with the state before we cease service. Pennsylvania law requires all active entities to maintain a current registered office at all times.

                  <strong>Standard Plan:</strong> We receive and forward physical mail to your designated mailing address weekly.<br/><br/>
                  <strong>Digital Plan:</strong> We scan the exterior of envelopes and upload images to your secure portal within 24 hours. You can request we open and scan contents, forward originals, or shred routine items.<br/><br/>
                  <strong>Service of Process:</strong> If we receive legal papers (summons, subpoena, lawsuit), we immediately email and text you, then overnight the originals to your designated address. You'll know within hours, not days. All mail handling follows your written instructions in the service agreement.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  Service of process is our top priority. The moment we receive legal documents, we take immediate action: (1) Email and SMS notification sent to you within 1 hour, (2) Documents photographed and uploaded to your secure portal, (3) Originals shipped via overnight delivery to your designated address, (4) Signed acceptance logged and archived. You'll have legal papers in hand the next business day with proof of service acceptance. This fast notification gives you maximum time to consult with your attorney and respond appropriately.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  Our address is specifically for your registered office with the PA Department of State and official business correspondence. You may also use it as your principal office address in state filings if needed. However, it cannot be used as a general mailing address for marketing materials, personal mail, or as a public-facing business address on your website or marketing collateral. If you need a full business mailing address with mail forwarding for all business correspondence, ask us about our Virtual Mailbox service ($50/month), which can be bundled with your registered office service.

                  Yes. We offer form preparation assistance for Pennsylvania LLC and corporation formation, DBA registration, and other state filings. Our team can help you prepare the necessary forms with information you provide, though we cannot provide legal advice on entity selection or custom legal drafting. Typical fees: LLC formation assistance $149 (plus $125 state fee), Corporation formation assistance $199 (plus $125 state fee). As a registered office client, you receive priority service and 10% off all business filing assistance. Visit our Business Filing Services page or call us to discuss your needs.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed pt-4">
                  We require 30 days' written notice to cancel. This gives you adequate time to file a Statement of Change with the PA Department of State to update your registered office to a new address. Canceling without updating your state filing could result in non-compliance and administrative dissolution of your entity. We'll provide instructions and forms to help you transition smoothly. Refunds are not provided for unused portions of annual subscriptions, but we'll continue service through the end of your 30-day notice period.
