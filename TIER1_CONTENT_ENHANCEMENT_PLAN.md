polk: {
  name: "Polk",
  slug: "polk",
  county: "Venango County",
  zipCodes: ["16342"],
  nearbyComm: ["Franklin", "Cooperstown", "Emlenton", "Rouseville"],
  landmarks: [
    "Allegheny River scenic waterfront",

    "Community Memorial Garden",
    "Polk Elementary School building"
  ],
  description: "Tight-knit Allegheny River borough in Venango County offering peaceful small-town living with excellent fishing, strong volunteer spirit, and genuine community pride",
  population: "~850",
  uniqueTrait: "Polk embodies everything great about small-town Pennsylvania - where the volunteer fire department's pancake breakfast is the social event of the month, Friday night fish fries bring everyone together, and neighbors still leave doors unlocked. The Allegheny River flowing through town provides world-class smallmouth bass fishing that anglers drive hours to experience, while Polk Borough Park serves as the community's living room where generations gather for Little League games, summer concerts, and the annual community picnic that's been a tradition since 1952. With 850 residents who genuinely know each other, Polk proves you don't need size to have heart.",
  historicalNarrative: "Founded in 1853 and incorporated in 1870, Polk grew as a river town serving Allegheny River traffic and local farming communities. The borough's name honors President James K. Polk, reflecting the era's patriotic naming traditions. During the lumber boom of the 1880s-90s, Polk thrived as logs floated down the Allegheny to sawmills, and the town's Main Street bustled with businesses serving loggers and river workers. When the lumber era ended, Polk could have become a ghost town like so many Pennsylvania river communities. Instead, residents doubled down on community - founding the volunteer fire department in 1925, establishing borough parks and recreation, and creating annual traditions that kept families rooted. The Allegheny River's smallmouth bass fishery discovered in the 1960s-70s brought a new generation of visitors, while families stayed for the intangible benefits of true small-town living - where kids play outside until dark, everyone attends high school sports, and community potlucks feel like family reunions. Today, Polk's population has remained stable for 70 years because people don't leave - they raise families, retire here, and pass their homes to children who appreciate what money can't buy.",
  favoriteThings: [
    "Exceptional Allegheny River smallmouth bass fishing - 18+ inch fish common",
    "Polk Volunteer Fire Department's legendary Friday night fish fries",
    "Community pancake breakfasts where everyone shows up",
    "Polk Borough Park summer concerts and Little League games",
    "Annual community picnic tradition dating to 1952",
    "River kayaking and canoeing for all skill levels",
    "Safe streets where kids bike everywhere and play outside",
    "Christmas lights contest that takes decorating seriously",
    "Knowing literally everyone - and their grandparents"
  ],
  imagePrompt: "Exact photorealistic view of downtown Polk at sunset showing Main Street storefronts along Route 62, the Allegheny River visible behind buildings with golden light reflecting off calm water, Polk Borough Park in foreground with families playing at playground, volunteer fire department building with trucks visible, anglers fishing from the riverside, children riding bikes on sidewalk, American flag flying from borough building, autumn colors on surrounding hills, small-town Pennsylvania evening atmosphere where everyone waves. This is THE view every Polk resident knows by heart."
